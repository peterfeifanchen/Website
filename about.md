As one of my friend once put it, this blog of my running stream of consciousness on economics, 
computer science and society-at-large may potentially burn most of my social capital. However, 
I believe dissident ideas are what have always pushed the world forward. If certain posts make yo
angry, instead of spreading that anger, I invite you to ask yourself why. Further, if you feel 
deeply offended by the content of some posts, I highly recommend that you periodically look in 
the mirror and make attempts at laughing at yourself; otherwise, life would be far too short. 

As a blog is a function that transforms capricious young idealism into permanent etches in the 
dark recesses of the internet, at the time of your reading, I may or may not still believe these 
words to be true due to the natural process of personal growth and maturity. 
 
The timeline of my sometimes exciting, but mostly mundane life goes roughly like this:
1. Born amidst a MRSA outbreak in a Shanghai hospital during the dawn of the Chinese renaissance.
The first month of my life was spent in quarantine in the maternity ward. This subliminal social 
isolation at so young an age drove a deep schism in my ability to comprehend positive human 
emotions such as, but not limited to, human compassion and goodness. However, it has allowed me 
to claim affirmative action status and tell a tale of triumph in the face of adversity ever since.
This was truly my personal Vietnam. 
2. Moved to a quiet and uneventful suburb of Vancouver. Nothing extraordinary occurred during 
this period. 
3. Moved to Toronto for undergraduate education in search of greatness.
4. Dabbled in photonics, culminated in a publication in ACS Nano. It had something to do with 
novel detection techniques for in-situ detection of cancer. As science is always done in 
incremental steps, this paper mainly dealt with the analysis of CdTe raman modes in aqueous 
solutions.
5. Dabbled in wireless systems and signal processing, culminated in undergraduate thesis on
"Variational Inference algorithms for phase-noise, carrier frequency offset and channel estimation
in MIMO-OFDM systems". However I realized too late that the quality of research is inversely 
proportional to the length of the title.
6. Temporary period of insanity where I became a banker during the European financial crisis.
7. Returned to Vancouver. You either go big or go home. I went home. While I am 
confident that I am smarter than 99.9999% of the currently living human population, my very 
expensive education at University of Toronto's flagship program helped me realize just how big a 
number 0.0001% of 7 billion people still is and how they all invariably choose life paths that 
collide with my aspirations. Given competition at the top increases exponentially and is 
extremely self-selective, and the fact that my ambitions had begun to outstrip my abilities, 
I decided the only way to win is not to play. 
8. Dabbled in the broader field of systems during graduate school with interest in networking 
and distributed systems, culminated in a couple of failed conference submissions on active data
and stateless middleboxes. Efforts to rectify this is still ongoing.
9. Dabbled in machine learning and economics, both respectable and natural directions to pursue 
given my background in systems, wireless signal processing and finance. 
10. As an enlightened soul, these days you will find me reading papers on systems (OSDI, SOSP, 
SIGCOMM, EUROSYS, MOBISYS, IEEE Transactions), machine learning (NIPS, ICML), and economics 
(/r/economics) during my morning commutes. 

Ever since graduation, I have discovered spare time. It is great. When I am not dabbling, you 
may find me sketching, sailing, swing dancing, snowboarding, bouldering, learning French, and 
travelling. I am also rumoured to write once in a while and strongly maintain that my current 
career is just a gig until a sitting Prime Minister realizes my talents as a speech writer. 

<span style="color:red">Warning:</span> I do not believe I am especially gifted in any of these 
topics. Expert opinions should always be sourced from those who don't have to write their own 
wikipedia pages.
