I am broadly interested in systems, machine learning, economics, signal processing and finance.
I've dabbled a bit in each. You will usually find me reading papers on systems (OSDI, SOSP, 
SIGCOMM, EUROSYS, MOBISYS, IEEE Transactions), machine learning (NIPS, ICML), and economics 
(/r/economics and blogs) during my morning commutes. 

When I am not dabbling, you may find me sketching, sailing, swing dancing, snowboarding, 
bouldering, learning French, and travelling. I am also rumoured to write once in a while and 
strongly maintain that my current career is just a gig until a sitting Prime Minister realizes 
my talents as a speech writer. 

The timeline of my sometimes exciting, but mostly mundane life is outlined below.

	     <p> Dabbled in the broader field of systems during graduate school with interest in 
		 networking and distributed systems which culminated in a couple of failed conference 
		 submissions on active data and stateless middleboxes. Efforts to rectify this is 
		 still ongoing.</p>

		 <p>Returned to Vancouver. My education at University of Toronto confirmed my longheld 
		 belief that I am smarter than 99.9999% of the human race, but it also helped me realize 
		 just how big a number 0.0001% of 7 billion people still. Unfortunately, the 0.0001% 
		 all invariably choose life paths that collide with my aspirations. The higher the climb,
		 the steeper was the ascent. My ambitions had begun to outpace my ability. I decided the 
		 only way to win was not to play.</p>

As one of my friend once put it, this blog of my running stream of consciousness on economics, 
computer science and society-at-large may contain dissident ideas and devil's advocacies that 
may potentially burn most of my social capital. However, I believe dissident ideas are what have 
always driven the world forward. If certain posts make you angry, instead of spreading that anger,
I invite you to ask yourself why. Further, if you feel deeply offended by the content of some 
posts, I strongly urge to consider looking at yourself in the mirror and proceed to practice 
laughing at yourself. Life would be far too short otherwise. As a blog is a function that 
transforms capricious young idealism into permanent etches in the dark recesses of the internet, 
at the time of your reading, I may or may not still believe these words to be true due to the 
natural process of personal growth and maturity. 

<span style="color:red">Warning:</span> I do not believe I am especially gifted in any of these 
topics. Expert opinions should always be sourced from those who don't have to write their own 
wikipedia pages.
