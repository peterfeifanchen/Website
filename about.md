* PhD (LOL? tbd I guess)
* MSc Computer Science, University of British Columbia 2016
* B.A.Sc Engineering Science, University of Toronto 2013

I am broadly interested in systems, machine learning, economics, signal processing and finance.
I've dabbled a bit in each without being an expert in any. I mostly try to keep up-to-date by 
reading papers on systems (OSDI, SOSP, SIGCOMM, EUROSYS, MOBISYS, IEEE Wireless Transactions), 
machine learning (NIPS, ICML), and economics (/r/economics, blogs). 

When I am not dabbling, you may find me sketching, sailing, swing dancing, snowboarding, 
bouldering, learning French, and travelling. I am also rumoured to write once in a while. Sometimes,
I think  my current career is just a gig until a sitting Prime Minister realizes 
my talents as a speech writer.
