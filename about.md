As one of my friend puts it, this blog of my running stream of consciousness on topics in economics, 
computer science and society may potentially burn most of my social capital. However, I believe dissident 
ideas are what have always pushed the  world forward. If certain posts makes you angry, I invite you to 
ask yourself why, instead of spreading that anger. Further, if you feel deeply offended by the content of 
some posts, I highly recommend that you periodically look in the mirror and make attempts at laughing at
yourself. Given that a blog is a function that etches living ideas onto static vessels, and the fact that
words in the Internet may live forever while the person may change, at the time of reading, I may or may
not believe these words to be true. 
 
The timeline of my sometimes exciting, but mostly mundane life goes roughly like this:
1. Born amidst a MRSA outbreak in a Shanghai hospital during the dawn of the Chinese renaissance.
2. Moved to a quiet and uneventful suburb of Vancouver.
3. Moved to Toronto for undergraduate education in the belief that it will lead to greatness.
4. Dabbled in photonics, culminating in a publication in ACS Nano.
5. Dabbled in wireless systems and signal processing, culminating in undergraduate thesis on
"Variational Inference algorithms for phase-noise, carrier frequency offset and channel estimation
in MIMO-OFDM systems", to only realize too late that the quality of research is inversely proportional
to the length of the title.
6. Temporary period of insanity where I became a banker during the European financial crisis.
7. The prodigal son returns to Vancouver. You either go big or go home. I went home. While I am 
confident that I am smarter than 99.9999% of the currently living human population, my very expensive
education at University of Toronto's flagship program helped me realize just how big a number 0.0001%
of 7 billion people still is. Given competition at the top increases exponentially, and the fact that 
my ambitions had begun to outstrip my abilities, I decided it is best not to play. 
8. Began dabbling in the broader field of systems during graduate school with interest in networking 
and distributed systems, culminating in a couple of failed submissions with topics in active data
and stateless middleboxes. Efforts to rectify this is still ongoing.
9. Began dabbling in machine learning and economics, both respectable natural directions to pursue 
given my background in systems, wireless signal processing and finance. These days you will find me reading 
papers on systems (OSDI, SOSP, SIGCOMM, EUROSYS, MOBISYS, IEEE Transactions), machine learning (NIPS, CVPR), 
and economics (/r/economics) during my morning
commutes. 

Ever since graduation, I've discovered spare time, it is great. I've began dabbling in sketching, sailing, swing dancing,
snowboarding, bouldering, learning French and travelling.
